            <p class="lorem">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a formal language for decorating and describing the appearance of a document ( web page ) written using a markup language (most often HTML or XHTML ). Can also be applied to any XML documents , such as SVG or XUL . CSS is used by web page creators to specify the colors , fonts , styles, placement of individual blocks, and other aspects of the presentation of the appearance of those web pages. The main purpose of CSS development is to fence off and separate the description of the logical structure of a web page (which is produced using HTML or other markup languages ) from the description of that web page's appearance (which is now produced using the formal language of CSS). This separation can increase document accessibility, provide greater flexibility and control over its presentation, and reduce complexity and repetition in structural content.

                In addition, CSS allows the same document to be presented in different styles or output methods , such as screen presentation, print presentation, voice reading (by a special voice browser or screen reader), or output by devices that use Braille .</p>
